------- Test your blue bin knowledge -------

This app will allow the user to test their knowledge
of what goes in the blue bin (recycling bin) in Toronto.

                 // MVP //
-------------------------------------------

My MVP is creating a simple quiz that functions as it should.

- 8 questions, 4 options 1 result
- restart functionality
- all of the functions, methods, and variables work properly
- all information  & items on the page is displayed properly for the user and
functions as it should
- accessible for all users (tabbing, enter/space allows
user to go to next question etc)
- dry code (in general)


            // Stretch Goals //
-------------------------------------------

- fix up the design if it's not where I want it to be
when app is complete
- dryer code (if possible)
- add more media queries (if not enough)
- add more design elements (illustrations, etc)


             // Pseudo code //
-------------------------------------------

The app will ask the user 8 questions +
there will be 4 options for the user to choose from.
Only one answer will be correct per question!

Set up the structure of the quiz in HTML file:
      create a div to hold quiz
      create 8 divs to hold each question
      create a button for 'next question' button
      create a final div to display user's score
      create a button to restart game

   - set id's to each div to select and store
   references to them in variables -

Set up quiz functions:
      create a blueBinQuiz function (will display quiz right away)
      create a showScore function (will display score for user)
      create a myQuestions function

On submitting the quiz, show results
      add an event listener to the submit button and when the user
      clicks, it will show their score

Set up variables in Javascript file:
      create variable for quiz container
      create variable for question container
      create variable for html radio button
      create variable for questions
      create variable for 'next question' button
      create variable for score container
      create variable for restart button

      create a variable to store list of possible answers
      in a loop
            code to run for each question

Set up a variable that stores the HTML questions & answers
(this will go in the loop)
      create a variable that stores user's choices from the html output

The user's score starts at 0
****
ex: set total score to 0
    set score counter to 1

Build HTML for each question...
Loop through each

questions variable . forEach function
   answers variable that stores list of possible answers
   loop
   radio button


Set up an array with objects (of the questions) under the questions variable
****
ex: questions variable
   question: "lorem lorem",
   answers:
      a: 'this one'
      b: 'that one'
      c: 'maybe this'
      d: 'maybe that'
   
   correct answer variable: 'the correct answer key'
   ,

   -- repeat until all questions are done --

****** how to link answers to an image instead of having questions as text???? ******
add images to elements to make dynamic?

If the user gets the answer correct, they will gain
a point and will be prompted.
****
ex: if user's answer is correct
      prompt 'correct!'
    else
      prompt 'wrong :( ...along with a reason why wrong answer is
      not allowed in the blue bin'

^ The user will also receive information as to why
the "wrongAnswer" is not allowed in the blue bin.

If the user gets the answer wrong, their score will remain
the same. They won't lose any points.
****
ex: if user's answer is correct
      create a function that will add 1 point to user's score
    else
      create a function that will maintain the user's score

If the user doesn't choose an answer, they will be alerted to do so.
****
ex: if user's answer is null
      alert user to choose an answer

Once the user has finished the quiz, they get their results
but they also have the option to restart.
****
ex: define a function that restarts the game
      when user clicks on restart button, run a function
      that resets all of the variables.
